# Documentation Source Folder

This folder contains source files of **ESP-Docs User Guide** available in [English](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-docs/en/latest/).

The sources do not render well in GitHub and some information is not visible at all.

# Building Documentation

The documentation is built using the python package `esp-docs`, which can be installed by running `pip install esp-docs`. Running `build-docs --help` will give a summary of available options. For more information, see [Building Documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-docs/en/latest/building-documentation/index.html).
